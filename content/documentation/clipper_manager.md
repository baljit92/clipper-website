You can use the Clipper manager Python library to start and manage a Clipper instance.

The Clipper manager library can be installed with pip. We recommend
using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) as your Python
installation.

```
pip install clipper_admin
```


A user guide and hosted API docs for the Clipper manager are coming soon.
Until then, the best place to find API documentation are the method comments in
the `clipper_manager.py` [source code](https://github.com/ucbrise/clipper/blob/release-0.1/clipper_admin/clipper_manager.py).
