You can use the Clipper manager Python library to start and manage a Clipper instance.

The Clipper manager library can be installed with pip. We recommend
using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) as your Python
installation.

```
pip install clipper_admin
```


A user guide is coming soon.
In the meantime, you can check out the [API Documentation](http://docs.clipper.ai).
