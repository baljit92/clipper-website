### Developing Clipper

Development of Clipper is coordinated through GitHub.

Clipper is under active development. Feel free to raise issues if you have any questions. 
Also, send us emails for any inquiry clipper-dev@gmail.com

To get started, clone the [repository](https://github.com/ucbrise/clipper)
including submodules:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ucbrise/clipper.git
```

{{% notice note %}}
If you've already cloned the repository at this point without the submodules,
you can include them by running `git submodule update --init --recursive` in
the Clipper repo.

__Build Dependencies:__

+ Boost
+ cmake >= 3.2
+ zeromq >= 4.1.0
+ hiredis
+ libev
+ redis-server >= 3.2
+ [Facebook Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly)



__Building Clipper:__

First generate the CMake files with `./configure`. This generates an out-of-source build directory called `debug`.
Go into this directory and then run `make` to actually
compile the code. You should only need to re-run the configuration script if you change one of the `CMakeLists.txt` files.
To build for release, run `./configure --release` which generates the `release` build directory instead of debug.
If you want to clean everything up, you can run `./configure --cleanup` (if you get tired of being prompted, you can run `./configure --cleanup-quiet` to force cleanup without prompting).


{{% notice note %}}
Redis must be installed and on your path to run both the query REST frontend and the unit-tests.
You can test this with `redis-server --version`.
{{% /notice %}}

For example:

```sh
cd $CLIPPER_ROOT_DIR
./configure
cd debug
make

# write some code and compile it
make

# build and run unit tests with googletest
../bin/run_unittests.sh
```

Clipper has been tested on OSX 10.12 and on Debian stretch/sid and Ubuntu 12.04 and 16.04. It does not support Windows.

To file a bug or request a feature, please file a GitHub issue. Pull requests are welcome.

Before filing a pull request, make sure that C++ and Java code conforms to the project's Clang-Format style file and Python code conforms to the PEP 8 style. To automatically format your code before submitting a pull request, you can use
the provided formatting script:

```sh
./bin/format_code.sh
```

### Clipper Dev Docker Image

We packaged all dev dependency in Docker Image as well. You can use the following to avoid set up local environment and use Docker instead:

```sh
docker run -it --network=host -v <LOCAL_PATH_TO_CLIPPER>:/clipper -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp:/tmp clipper/dev:develop
```
```sh
docker run -it --network=host -v /home/ubuntu/clipper:/clipper -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp:/tmp clipper/py35-dev:develop
```

<!-- Development planning and progress is tracked with the [Clipper Jira](https://clipper.atlassian.net/projects/CLIPPER/issues). -->
