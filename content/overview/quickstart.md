The easiest way to get started using Clipper is to install the `clipper_admin` pip package and use it interactively from a Python
REPL.
The Clipper admin contains the [Clipper manager]({{< relref "documentation/clipper_manager.md" >}}) which can be used to start and manage a Clipper instance.

**Dependencies:** Before using Clipper, you must install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and the [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution.

```
$ pip install clipper_admin
$ python
```

Once you have the `clipper_admin` package installed, you can use it to start a Clipper instance and deploy your first model.
When you use the Clipper manager to start a Clipper instance, it will run Clipper in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).


From the Python REPL:

```py
>>> import clipper_admin.clipper_manager as cm
# Start a Clipper instance on localhost
>>> clipper = cm.Clipper("localhost")
Checking if Docker is running...
>>> clipper.start()
Clipper is running

# Register an application called "hello_world" that will query a model
# called "feature_sum_model". This will create a prediction REST endpoint
# at http://localhost:1337/hello_world/predict
>>> clipper.register_application("hello_world", "feature_sum_model", "doubles", "-1.0", 100000)
Success!

# Inspect Clipper to see the registered apps
>>> clipper.get_all_apps()
[u'test']

# Define a simple model that just returns the sum of each feature vector.
# Note that the prediction function takes a list of feature vectors as
# input and returns a list of strings.
>>> def pred(xs):
      return [str(np.sum(x)) for x in xs]

# Deploy the model, naming it "feature_sum_model" and giving it version 1
>>> clipper.deploy_predict_function("feature_sum_model", 1, pred, "doubles")
```

If your Docker installation requires root access, you can pass
the keyword argument `sudo=True` when constructing a `clipper_manager.Clipper()`
instance to tell the Clipper manager to execute Docker commands as root.
Unfortunately, this only works when running Clipper in remote mode currently.
You can find an explanation for the problem and a workaround in [#179](https://github.com/ucbrise/clipper/issues/179).

Now that you've deployed your first model, you can start requesting predictions at the
REST endpoint that clipper created for your application:
`http://localhost:1337/hello_world/predict`

With curl:

```sh
$ curl -X POST --header "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"input": [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]}' 127.0.0.1:1337/hello_world/predict

{"query_id":0,"output":6.6,"default":false}
```

From a Python REPL:

```py
>>> import requests, json, numpy as np
>>> headers = {"Content-type": "application/json"}
>>> requests.post("http://localhost:1337/hello_world/predict", headers=headers, data=json.dumps({"input": list(np.random.random(10))})).json()
```
