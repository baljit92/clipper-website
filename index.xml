      <description>This tutorial is organized as a tour of the Clipper Admin API. It will walk you through the key concepts needed to understand how to create a Clipper cluster and deploy models to it, explaining each concept as it comes up.
A Clipper Cluster A running Clipper cluster consists of a collection of Docker containers communicating with each other over the network. As you issue commands against Clipper using the Clipper Admin tool, you are communicating with these containers as well as creating new ones or destroying existing ones.</description>

The main API for interacting with Clipper is exposed via a ClipperConnection object. This is your handle to a Clipper cluster.</description>

      <description>Guidance on how to identify and fix some common errors.
Identifying the cause of default predictions There are a few reasons why your application may be returning default predictions. Your first debugging clue is the &amp;ldquo;default_explanation&amp;rdquo; field in the response body.
